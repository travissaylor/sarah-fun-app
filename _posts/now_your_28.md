Happy 28th Birthday Honey!! I'm so happy that I get to enjoy another one of your bithdays with you. I want to take a moment to express how much I love and appreciate you.

Your unwavering support has been a constant source of strength for me. I know I can be hard to be around when I am frustrated but you find ways to pull me out of my func and I really appreciate that. Your empathy is one of your most beautiful qualities, and it's something I've always admired about you. 

I've watched you grow over the years, and it's been a joy to see the amazing person you've become. You've faced challenges that have seemed insurmountable, and you've come out stronger on the other side. I know things have not always been easy but I've enjoyed being on the journey with you! I'm so excited to enjoy this chapter in our lives together and to take on what comes next.

I love you so much honey! Days like today always are a nice little reminder of how wonderful you are and how many people love you. Can't wait to watch some Lewberger tonight!!
