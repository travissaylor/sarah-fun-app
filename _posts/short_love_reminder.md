I sometimes think back to the beginning of our relationship and how different life was back then. We had classes, projects, papers, and deadlines but none of it was as difficult as it seemed in the moment.

One quiet moment that I will never forget, was one that I never told you about. I remember walking back from lynch after a night of work, stressing about all the things I needed to do. As I reached the art gallery, my worries were replaced with the pure joy of getting to see you. In that moment, I was overwhelmed with clarity. Even though our future was unclear, I knew I would do everything in my power to build a future with you.

From there, the decision to move to Nashville with you was simple. I would find a way no matter what. I knew that as long as I was with you, everything would work itself out. The truth is, it took a lot of effort, energy, cooperation, and problem solving to build our relationship to the point it is today. But honestly, I would go through all the challenging times 1000000 times again, if it meant I got to spend another day with you.

Writing these brings me so much joy because a lot of times I don't express how I feel enough. It helps break me from my daily mindset and reminds me of whats really important in my life

I love you more than you know!
