Hey sweet pea. I hope when you get a chance to read this, you are having an awesome day. If you aren't, thats okay too and I hope this note will help just a little.

I know its been a tough few weeks for you with your summer course in full swing. Even though it has felt like a struggle, I've seen growth in you throughout the process. I know you may not be exactly where you think you should be but take a second to look back and see how far you've come, not only as a philosopher, but as an incredibly talented young woman. 

You have become an activist for the things that you believe in and you don't just talk the talk. You've been vegan now for over a year and I am constantly impressed with your dedication to your morals. There are many moments when it would be easier to eat animal products but you've stayed steady. This consistency and dedication is something that I admire. I am so proud of you and so glad I've gotten to watch you grow throughout your journey.

Its easy to forget about all the amazing things that are going right in your life when things get though. I want you to know that there are SO MANY things that you do, that are absolutely incredible. I sometimes forget to tell you that and I hope these notes can serve as a reminder to me and you of how great you are.

Thanks for being my partner till the end. I love you so much sweetheart.
