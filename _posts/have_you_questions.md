You're Almost there honey!!! You've made it so far! Its completely natural to feel nevervous and I know at times you're going to feel overwhelmed... and thats completely NORMAL. I've seen you fight your way through a lot of exams, papers, deadlines, and so much more! Guess what? You've triumped over every single thing in your way. I don't think you realize how successful you have been!

Now that you have your questions, you have a new hurdle to jump (my high school track star :P). I have no doubt in my mind that this will be another successful endeavor for you.

I can't wait to celebrate with you but for the time being I will help you in any way that I can. Don't worry about the house, cleaning, dishes, etc. If you're feeling overwhelmed, lets talk it out. If you want to snuggle on the couch, I'm your guy. If you want some late night taco bell, I'll run be back in 15 with some vegetarian cheesey stuff. Let me know and I'll do my best :D

Thanks for being you. I love you honey!
