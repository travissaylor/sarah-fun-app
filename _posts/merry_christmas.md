Merry Christmas Honey. Another year down with my partner in crime. I am so happy that I get to do it all again with the sweetest girl I've ever known.

Through thick and thin we always have each others back and that is probably my favorite part of the love that we share. It's not always easy but we find a way to handle it together.

I am very proud of everyhting that you have accomplished to this point in your life. You are an extremely smart and capable woman that exceeds my expectations everyday. You are crushing grad school and you are only getting better with time. Most people don't see all the effort, energy, intelligence and mental stamina (propbably some episodes of the office as well) that takes to do what you do, but I see all of it and I am amazed how well you handle it. You make me proud everyday.

Our life has blossemed together over the past 3 years. We've uprooted our lives to chase our dreams, adopted the bestest boi in the entire planet, watched the office 4 times, and a billion other things. All I know is that I will probably watch the office again by the time its all said and done and that I want to watch it with you.

I love you so so very much. Merry christmas!
