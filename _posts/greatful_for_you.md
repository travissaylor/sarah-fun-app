Last October was the start of a terrible stretch of time for me. I was incredibly anxious, I hated myself, and I just wished I could return to the old me. I was truly a mess. I tried to hide how bad I was feeling as much as I could but sometimes it would be unavoidable. I really didn't know what to do. 

Through all of that, you were the one thing that I could count on. You were always there for me through every step of the way. You helped me calm down when I would have panic attacks. You rubbed my arm and held my hand when I was an anxious mess. You helped my find ways to help myself. I am so incredibly grateful for everything you've done for me. I don't how I would've gotten through that time period if it wasn't for you. Thank you x10000. There is no way I can repay you for all that you've done but I want to help where I can.

I know these past few weeks have been really tough but I can absolutely empathize with your situation. Just know that I care about your feelings and I will be there for you through anything that you need. Don't forget that we're a team. Your my partner till the end!

I wouldn't want to binge every Marvel movie/show to date with any other person in the entire world! You really are my person. I'm in love! I was hit by Cupid's sparrow. Okay I leave the quotes to the quote generator. Love you Sar Bear.
